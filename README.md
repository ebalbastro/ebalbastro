- 👋 Hi, I’m @ebalbastro
- 👀 I’m interested in Crypto Projects now. But who knows, perhaps I'll made a project that'll change everyone's life (for good).
Also I'm trying to introduce me in OpenRAN, to do something in 5G/6G world.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to make my own crypto, don't worry, all the cryptos today are so good to imagine something better.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing now, just looking other good projects.
- 📫 How to reach me:
Send me an email to e.balbastro@gmail.com
